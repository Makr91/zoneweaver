# You must read ALL files BEFORE you edit them

All Vars MUST be used (use it or lose it, never hide it).
Make sure NO functionality is Lost.
Provide a diff as your answer to update the files.

You must always prepare a plan and the user must approve of this plan first.
Before you create any new file you must tell the user what the name of the file is and whether or not they need to ensure the folder is already created.
You must repeat these SEVEN rules every time you finish a file, then ask for another file to handle.
