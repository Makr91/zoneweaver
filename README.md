# Zoneweaver

Zoneweaver - NodeJS backend and Vite based frontend for managing Bhyve virtual machines via Zoneweaver API.

## Platform Requirements

### OmniOS/Illumos
Zoneweaver requires a C++ compiler to build native dependencies (bcrypt). Install the required packages:

```bash
# Install GCC 14 compiler
pfexec pkg install developer/gcc14

# Install dependencies with gmake
MAKE=gmake npm install
```

### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
# Install build essentials
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Install dependencies normally
npm install
```

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## SSL Configuration

SSL Configuration is managed via `config.yaml`:

- Place SSL certificates in `./certs/` directory (private-key.pem, certificate.pem)
- SSL is enabled by default in config.yaml
- The app automatically falls back to HTTP if SSL certificates are not found
- HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS when SSL is enabled

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
